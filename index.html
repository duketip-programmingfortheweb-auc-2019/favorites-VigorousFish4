<h1>An Introduction to Brawlhalla</h1>

<hr>
<h2>What is Brawlhalla?</h2>
<p>Brawlhalla is a free platforming game on PC, Xbox One, PS4 and Nintendo Switch. The player picks a legend to fight against other legends on a big map. Each legend has an unique set of 2 weapons and their own signature attacks (or sigs for short) that do more damage for the price a higher amout of recovery frames.
    Attacks change based on which direction your legend is moving, and whether or not your character is in the air. There are different modes to play with the main mode being free for all, where four legends try to knock each other out for 8 minutes. Knockouts are the only way to score points, falls are when you get knocked out by another legend and
    accidents are when you knock yourself out. Every knockout is 2 points to your score. Every fall is -1 point to your score and every accident is -3 points from your score. The legend with the highest score wins the game. There are also ranked matches you can play for glory, which you can use to buy stuff in Mallhalla, which
    is the store.

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>Odin, King of the Gods built a heaven for the greatest warriors in history and called it Valhalla. Odin decreed than fallen heroes would feast in this golden hall until the end of time, when they would join him at Ragnorok, the final gloriois battle
    between the gods and the giants.
</p>
<p>Odin commanded the Valkyries, beautiful goddesses of war, to take to their winged horses and scour the cosmos for the greatest warriors to fill his hall. At the moment of a Legend’s heroic death in battle, the Valkyries would offer up a seat in Valhalla.</p>
<p>Valkyries searched far and wide, fiercely competing to bring back the greatest warriors. Soon, to Odin’s surprise, pirates, cowboys, Mongol warriors, Amazons, even monsters and aliens roamed the Great Hall.</p>
<p>If Odin thought his hall would be peaceful, he did not know his own warriors. Constant battle spilled out of the Great Hall, and Asgard was smashed to rubble again and again. In an effort to keep some semblance of order and reduce his already cosmic cleaning bills, 
    Odin created the Grand Tournament of Valhalla.</p>
<p>Welcome to Brawlhalla.</p>
<p>Tournament-mania swept Asgard, fueled by the battle lust of the fighters and the wondrous prizes Odin offered the champions. Thor came to a counsel of the Gods wearing a green and gold Bodvar throwback jersey. 
    Dwarven stadium chants lasted for days as they recited every heroic deed of Scarlet in exquisite detail.  From elvish Brawlhalla fantasy leagues to lucrative mead endorsements, Brawlhalla is Asgard’s World Cup, NFL, and UFC all wrapped into one.</p>
<p>This is where we are today. The Tournament rages while gods look on and cheer. Thousands of Valhallan warriors compete in the Tournament, but our game concerns itself with only the very top fighters.  
    Who among them will vanquish all rivals and seize the mantle of Champion of Brawlhalla?</p>
<p>Listing all 44 legends in Brawlhalla will take too long so here are the Top 5 legends in order of greatness
